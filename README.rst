GridCompute is an open-source cross-platform tool that implements quickly distributed computing over a local grid.

The objective is to distribute resource intensive calculations over a local network to greatly reduce time needed, with a minimal work required for implementing it.

It can be particularly useful for engineering companies or universities.
